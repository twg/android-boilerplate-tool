# Getting started:

First of all, you must clone this repository in a directory in your machine.

In order to generate your TWG android boilerplate project, it is required to have Yeoman installed. If you haven't done this process, you might need to install it by performing the command bellow in your terminal:

```
npm install -g yo
```

After that, navigate to the _android-boilerplate-tool folder_ that you just cloned and execute:

```
npm install
```

This command will install all dependencies of the generator. Once everything is installed, go to the directory you want to generate the project.

``
yo path <TODO: We still have to fix this part>
``
